# SmO2-Sci-Analyzer-
The SmO2 Sci-Analyzer is a web-based tool designed to automate the mathematical modeling of Muscle Oxygen Saturation (SmO2) trends during incremental exercise tests. Unlike traditional scripts that force a specific model (e.g., Cubic), this tool intelligently selects the best-fitting mathematical pattern.
